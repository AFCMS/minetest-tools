# Minetest Tools
[Repository](https://github.com/GreenXenith/minetest-tools/) | [Issues](https://github.com/GreenXenith/minetest-tools/issues/)

## Features

- Minetest (5.1.0) Lua API code snippets
- Mod and game folder structure boilerplates
- `.luacheckrc` generator (globals only)

**Note:** Code snippets were generated from `lua_api.txt` using a Lua script. Quality of descriptions and amount of available snippets may be sub-par. `snippets.json` is __not__ pretty-printed.

## Extension Settings

* `minetest-tools.workspaceOnly`: Code snippets will only be shown if certain files/folders (`init.lua`, `mods`, `modpack.txt`) are detected in the main workspace folder (default: `true`).

## Release Notes

### 1.0.1: January 10, 2020
- Fixed extension not loading when not in a workspace
- Fixed workspace-only commands running when not in a workspace


### 1.0.0: January 10, 2020
